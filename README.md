# Machine Learning with Credit Risk

## Overview

Evaluate credit card data using multiple machine learning models to evaluate their efficacy at predicting credit risk. We are using scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn libraries to employ 6 differrent learning models to our data and will determine accuracy through a balanced accuracy score and recall metrics.

## Analysis

### - Naive Random Oversampling
Balanced Accuracy: 65.2%

Precision: 99%

Recall: 68%

## Summary
From these results we can see that the Balanced Random Forest and Easy AdaBoost Classifers are both nearly 30% more accurate that the other 4 models, with the Easy AdaBoost Classifier having a slight edge. That model will operate best when predicting results.
